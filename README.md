1.Introduction
In today's competitive digital marketing landscape, the ability to 
effectively analyze and optimize advertising campaigns is crucial for 
business success. This report aims to evaluate and enhance the 
performance of marketing campaigns conducted on two major 
platforms: Google Ads and Facebook Ads. By scrutinizing the data 
from multiple campaigns and ad sets, we seek to identify 
opportunities for scaling successful strategies, addressing 
underperformance issues, and rationalizing overall marketing efforts.
The objective of this assignment is to assess our ability to analyze 
marketing data from these channels, derive meaningful insights, and 
provide actionable recommendations. We will work with sample data 
from Google Ads and Facebook Ads for the month of April 2024, 
focusing on key performance metrics such as impressions, clicks, 
click-through rate (CTR), cost-per-click (CPC), total cost, 
conversions, leads, calls, treatment plans, and the types of calls 
(online and offline).
To guide our analysis, we will compare our findings against industry 
benchmarks and consider business constraints such as offline 
consultation capacity and revenue per call. The analysis will 
encompass data cleaning and preparation, descriptive analysis, 
benchmark comparison, insight generation, and providing strategic 
recommendations.
